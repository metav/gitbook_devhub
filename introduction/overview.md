# Overview

## The Vision: High-Quality Data for AI

OORT is building an open platform dedicated to generating high-quality data for Artificial Intelligence training. We believe that the foundation of powerful AI lies not just in algorithms, but in the purity/accuracy of the data it consumes.

To achieve this, we are decentralizing the entire **Data Supply Chain**.

## The Data Supply Chain

The journey from raw information to AI-ready datasets involves several critical steps. Developers play a pivotal role in designing the tooling and plugins for each of these stages:

1.  **Data Collection**: Gathering raw data from the web, IoT devices, or user inputs.
    *   *Developer Role*: Build crawlers, scrapers, or mobile apps that feed data into the hub.
2.  **Data Labeling**: Annotating data to make it understandable for machines.
    *   *Developer Role*: Create intuitive labeling interfaces or gamified tasks for the OORT Launchpad.
3.  **Data Verification**: Ensuring the collected and labeled data is accurate and authentic.
    *   *Developer Role*: Implement consensus algorithms or verification scripts (plugins) to audit data quality.
4.  **Data Cleaning**: Removing noise and formatting data for specific models.
    *   *Developer Role*: Develop automated cleaning pipelines and preprocessing tools.

## Empowering Developers

OORT Datahub is not just a storage solution; it is a canvas for your creativity. We provide the infrastructure, but you design the tools.

By developing plugins for the OORT Datahub, you are directly contributing to the global AI infrastructure. Whether you are building a niche image verification tool or a massive-scale text scraper, your contributions help businesses and researchers access the pristine data they need.

### Why Build on OORT?
*   **Monetization**: Earn rewards when your tools or data are utilized.
*   **Impact**: Power the next generation of AI models.
*   **Open Ecosystem**: A transparent, decentralized environment where innovation thrives.
